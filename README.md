             # #Virtual Lab Management System

This project is a web-based Virtual Lab platform created for college Computer Science students and teachers.
The idea is to provide a single place where lab subjects like Python, Java, DBMS can be managed and practiced online instead of using physical lab manuals.

Teachers can create subjects and add practical programs (PRs), and students can see those subjects on their dashboard and practice programs in sequence using an online code editor.




          ##What this platform does?

The platform works in two roles: Teacher and Student.

Teachers create lab subjects and add practical programs in proper order. Once a subject is active, it becomes visible to students.

Students log in, see available subjects, open a subject, and practice practicals one by one. Students cannot skip practicals, which helps maintain proper lab flow.

The goal is to make lab work structured, digital, and easy to manage for colleges.
